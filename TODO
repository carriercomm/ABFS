* Storage test

Reading a file:

* A file is requested
* The name is mapped to MD5 block id
* Block is loaded
* Decoder is determined, and loaded
* A number of bytes are accessed
* Blocks are requested by decoder
* Blocks are decoded and bytes extracted and returned

Writing a file:

* A file is opened
* Encoder is decided and loaded
* Bytes are written. Blocks are generated.
* Blocks close and flush.
* Blocklist kept by encoder
* File is closed.
* MD5 ID generated, and added to dir.

Blockid's are entirely based on content. Fileid is entirely based on 
content of inode.
